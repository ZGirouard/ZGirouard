		<h1 id="aboutHeader"> About Me </h1>
		<!-- make an about me description -->
		<p class="aboutInfo"> My interest in software began during my senior year in high school. I found myself browsing Stack Overflow and numerous websites during my "Intro to Java" class, teaching myself material that wasn't covered.</p>
		<p class="aboutInfo"> Currently, I'm a second-year student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln double majoring in Computer Science and Sociology. I've always been interested in the intersection between people and computer-interaction, and my majors have allowed me to explore this. Additionally, I'm a propenent of sustainability and accessibility when it comes to software development. </p>
		<p class="aboutInfo"> I'm also the VP for Internal Relations for Intialize, a volunteer club that teaches middle schoolers in the Lincoln school system to create their own websites. Furthermore, I participate in the UNL dodgeball club, which is consistently ranked top 10 in the NCDA. </p>
		<p class="aboutInfo"> In my free time, you can find me listening to music, going to concerts or art muesems, and skateboarding. Outside of my creative endeavors, I love thrift shoppping, lifting weights, and hitting up my local record store. </p>
